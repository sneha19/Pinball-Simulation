Pinball Simulation Project
Created by Sneha Ganesh
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow these instructions for compiling the code:

(1) Go to http://www.bluej.org/download/download.html and download the correct version
    of BlueJ for your computer
(2) Install the program. 
(3) Open up the interface and create new project by going to File-New Project
(4) Once the project is saved, open the folder with all the .java files and select all
    the files, drag and drop them into BlueJ.

Follow these steps to run the project:

(1) Run the main method in the Pinball class which should load the applet
    (right click on the pinball class and find public static void main(String[] args)
(2) Follow the information on the screen - make sure your number of trials
    is greater than 1000 and don't close the terminal window in BlueJ
(3) Select the radio button representing the data you want to see: 
    Targeted, Random or User data
(4) See your output in the terminal window!

Extra Credit:

Since creating an applet wasn't required, I would consider this the extra credit
portion of my program. I hope this is taken into consideration.
